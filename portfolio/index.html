          DomainElevation stewards multiple domain portfolios, each structured around a distinct thesis,
          time horizon, and role within the digital economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not operate a public inventory. Each portfolio reflects conviction in naming as
          infrastructure — not merchandise.

      <h2>AssetsNow</h2>
      <div class="stack">
        <p>
          AssetsNow is our flagship portfolio of category-defining digital assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          These assets occupy foundational naming positions across capital, infrastructure, identity, and
          coordination layers. They are held with long-term conviction and surfaced selectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          AssetsNow is extension-agnostic and intentionally scarce.

      <h2>Agent &amp; Command Interfaces</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio focuses on domain-native interaction surfaces — names designed to function as entry
        points for agents, workflows, and command-driven systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Infrastructure &amp; Identity</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio includes foundational naming primitives for regulated and trust-sensitive domains,
        including payments, compliance, coordination, and identity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Experimental &amp; Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        This portfolio captures asymmetric positions aligned with emerging behaviors, cultural shifts, and
        early language formation. Assets in this category are time-sensitive by design and evaluated
        dynamically as narratives mature or fade.
      </p>

        Most assets across these portfolios are held long-term. Select placements occur privately and intentionally.
