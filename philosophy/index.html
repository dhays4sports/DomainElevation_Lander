      <h2>Naming Is Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        A domain name is not a label. It is an interface between trust, memory, and coordination.
        The strongest digital names function as infrastructure — anchoring identity, enabling adoption,
        and reducing friction across time.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Conviction Over Velocity</h2>
      <p>
        We do not optimize for turnover. We believe the highest-value digital assets are those that define
        categories rather than features, persist across cycles, and accrue relevance as systems scale.
        Scarcity is a feature, not a constraint.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Quiet by Design</h2>
      <p>
        We operate privately and selectively. Most assets are not listed publicly. Most conversations begin
        with context, not transactions. This is intentional.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Stewardship, Not Speculation</h2>
      <p>
        Our role is to steward naming positions that matter — whether held, built upon, or placed.
        We view digital assets through the lens of durability, credibility, and long-term leverage.
